    "# Steganography: Hiding Star Wars in Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent as well as concealing the contents of the message. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) This notebook will use least significant bit steganography to hide 100s of KB to several MB of data in an image without perceptibly changing the image. This notebook completes 3 tasks using this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Encode all 3 of the original Star Wars scripts into an image of the Death Star.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Encode an image of R2D2 with an image of the Death Star Plans.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: Encode a series of encoded images within encoded images and end with the script for A New Hope (Death Star => X-Wing => R2D2 => Death Star Plans => New Hope Script).**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my attempt to duplicate the method without looking up tutorials or code samples on least significant bit steganography. My only knowledge going into this is a basic description of the method. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Least Significant Bit Image Steganography Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick rundown of how this works. Each pixel in a color image has a value for each of it's 3 color channel. These values are between 0 and 255 corresponding to how red, green, or blue that pixel is. These values can be converted to an 8 bit binary value (255 = 11111111, ect.). While changing the left-most bits can mean a lot of change to the value, the rightmost bits mean very little. We are going use the rightmost 2 bits for our encoding. Changing these 2 bits will change the value for that one color channel on that one pixel by *at most* 3 points but more likely less or not at all. The result is a difference in the final image that is imperceptible to the human eye. If we are willing to replace these 2 bits of the 8 bit value, we can use up to 1/4th of the image's total space for whatever else we want! If we convert our scripts to 8 bit binary as well, there is more than enough space in a single color image to replace the last 2 bits of each color channel with our scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Even more bits could be used for encoding. This allows for using more of the image's total space but runs the risk of making the changes more visible. The last 2 bits is plenty for this notebook and most encodings. )\n",

    "This was a fun and interesting project to engage in. I hope it introduces people to Steganography techniques. This notebook should function like the invisible ink toy equivalent to Steganography. I encourage people to play around with image Steganography and see what they can do. Naturally, if we were really trying to hide messages in images, we would at least add layers of encryption to our messages and not use public images. Regardless, Image Steganography is most often used for adding hidden watermarks to images and videos for copyright purposes. Let's leave with one last quick method to scramble the last 2 bits of an image to delete any least significant bit encoding from an image.\n"
